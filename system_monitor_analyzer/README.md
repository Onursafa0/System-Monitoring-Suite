# Windows System Performance Analyzer

This is a simple C++ console application that **analyzes and reports average system performance metrics** based on historical data collected in an SQLite database (`system_monitor.db`).

---

## Features

- Lists all **standard (non-critical) applications** recorded in the database.
- Calculates and displays **average CPU usage, RAM usage, I/O read and write counts** for a selected standard application.
- Calculates and displays **average network download and upload** usage.
- Uses a predefined list of **critical system processes** to exclude from standard applications.

---

## Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- SQLite3 library (`sqlite3.lib` and `sqlite3.h`) installed and accessible for compilation.
- A pre-existing `system_monitor.db` database file containing tables `ProcessData` and `NetworkData` with relevant data.  
  *(This database is generated by the system monitoring program that logs process and network stats.)*

---

## Database Schema Overview

The program expects the following tables in the database:

### `ProcessData` Table
| Column     | Type    | Description                     |
|------------|---------|---------------------------------|
| id         | INTEGER | Primary key (auto-increment)   |
| name       | TEXT    | Process name                   |
| pid        | INTEGER | Process ID                    |
| cpu_usage  | REAL    | CPU usage percentage          |
| ram_usage  | REAL    | RAM usage in megabytes        |
| read_count | REAL    | I/O read bytes in megabytes   |
| write_count| REAL    | I/O write bytes in megabytes  |
| timestamp  | DATETIME| Data record timestamp         |

### `NetworkData` Table
| Column     | Type    | Description                      |
|------------|---------|---------------------------------|
| id         | INTEGER | Primary key (auto-increment)    |
| download   | REAL    | Download bytes in megabytes     |
| upload     | REAL    | Upload bytes in megabytes       |
| timestamp  | DATETIME| Data record timestamp           |

## How It Works

- The program connects to the `system_monitor.db` SQLite database.
- It provides a simple text menu for the user to:
  - List **standard (non-critical) applications** and select one to view average performance statistics.
  - View average network usage statistics.
- Critical system processes (such as `svchost.exe`, `winlogon.exe`, `explorer.exe`, etc.) are excluded from the standard applications list to avoid clutter.
- When a standard application is selected, the program calculates the average CPU %, RAM usage, and I/O read/write counts from all recorded samples.
- Network averages are calculated over all stored network data samples.

## Building the Project

### Using Visual Studio

1. Install Visual Studio with the **Desktop development with C++** workload.
2. Download and install SQLite3 development files (`sqlite3.lib` and `sqlite3.h`).
3. Create a new Console Application project.
4. Add the source `.cpp` file to the project.
5. Link against the SQLite3 library.
6. Build the project.

### Using MinGW (GCC)

1. Install MinGW-w64 and ensure `g++` is in your PATH.
2. Download SQLite3 development files (`sqlite3.dll`, `libsqlite3.a`, and `sqlite3.h`).
3. Compile using a command similar to:

```bash
g++ -o system_monitor_analyzer.exe system_monitor_analyzer.cpp -lsqlite3 -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++
```

## Usage
Run the compiled executable from the command line:

```bash
system_monitor_analyzer.exe
```
The program will show a menu:
```bash
Select an option:
1. List and select standard applications
2. Calculate network averages
3. Exit
Enter your choice:
```
- Choose 1 to list standard applications and view their average CPU, RAM, and I/O stats.

- Choose 2 to view average network download and upload usage.

- Choose 3 to exit.

## Notes
- The program depends on having an existing `system_monitor.db` database populated by a system monitoring tool.

- It filters out critical Windows system processes from the list to focus on user and standard apps.

- Input validation is performed for menu and application selection.

- This tool is intended for offline analysis of previously collected performance data.
